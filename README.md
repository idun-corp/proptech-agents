# Proptech Agents

Prompts for **expert** and **embodied** autonomous AI agents for proptech — from real estate operations to building intelligence.

These prompts are designed to accelerate the creation of domain-aware, reasoning agents that understand properties, assets, and people in the built environment.

---

## What this is
This repository contains reusable **prompt templates** for AI agents built for the proptech ecosystem.

- **Experts** → specialized reasoning agents with deep knowledge of property and asset workflows.  
- **Embodied agents** → context-aware agents that act within and around buildings.

Each file in `/experts` and `/embodied` is a ready-to-use prompt foundation — adaptable across different LLMs and agent frameworks.

---

## Quick start
1. Browse the `/experts` or `/embodied` folders.  
2. Copy a prompt and adapt it for your own autonomous or multi-agent setup.  
3. Share improvements or new agents back with the community.

No setup, tools, or dependencies required — just text prompts ready to use or extend.
